# Working Code AMA

## Ask us anything!

You can [**Ask us a Question**](../../issues/new) by creating an issue in this repository. Anything is fair game to ask &mdash;it doesn't have to be about coding, or tech, or even the podcast&mdash; though of course we reserve the right not to answer them for what we hope are obvious reasons.

Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Making and spending money. Work. Life. Coding. Workflow. Setups.

## A little about us 🪂 🏋🏻‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 👨🏻‍🍳

If you want to go more in depth than what follows, we did two episodes of our "origin stories" ([Part 1: Ben and Tim](https://workingcode.dev/episodes/007-origin-stories-pt1/) -- [Part 2: Carol and Adam](https://workingcode.dev/episodes/008-origin-stories-pt2/)).

Adam is the CTO of [AlumnIQ](https://www.alumniq.com), a skydiver, woodworker, dad, and is probably too ambitious with hobbies. He lives in rural Pennsylvania, USA with his wife and two kids, two dogs, two cats, two birds, and a crested gecko.

Ben is a world champion CFML acolyte and works at [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) (he works on the legacy platform, if you haven't heard). He's a hobbyist bodybuilder, movie enthusiast, and feature flags fanboi. He lives in upstate New York, USA with his wife and pillow-humping dog, Lucy.

Carol is an engineering manager for [ClearCapital](https://www.clearcapital.com/). When not raising her two awesome sons (I met them. They _are_!) she's a running and fitness enthusiast, and she volunteers to support and promote women in tech. She lives in Georgia, USA with her husband and (for a little while longer) two kids.

Tim is an engineering manager for [PayCloud](https://www.paycloud.io/), and in his free time he enjoys being an extra in movies and TV (he was in Ozark), cosplay, and cooking both standard gourmet food and unique and uncommon dishes like alligator testicles or gnat spleen or something. He also lives in Georgia, USA with his wife and two kids.
